Hardcore Water
=================

Overview
--------

This mod prevents source blocks of water being placed using buckets. This means that:

 * Water must be transported to needed locations by player-built aqueducts and gravity.

 * Source blocks of water from world generation are much more valuable, and cannot be replaced when removed.

 * Any mod that add a water wheel as a source for mechanical power will better balanced with wind power, as you cannot place a source block of water adjacent to a water wheel for free, easy power.


Config Settings (`VintageStoryData/ModConfig/HardcoreWater.json`)
--------

None, at the moment...


Future Plans
--------

 * Mechanical screw pumps, which moves any adjacent water upward when powered; helpful for when water is needed at a higher elevation than nearby source blocks.


Known Issues
--------

 * Water placed from a bucket does not flow; this might require some coding to fix/update during placement.
